    "# Introduction \n",
    "Many of us wonder how to profit from the financial world, specifically the stock market. Logically, this task is very challenging and is one of the deeply researched fields in academia. According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), asset prices reflect all available information, indicating that it is impossible to regularly \"beat the market\" using solely historical data{cite}`malkiel2003efficient`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we will look to analyze how and what to predict the stock market through the S&P 500 index ((^GSPC)). By utilizing historical trading data from 1990 to 2025, we aim to answer the specific questions proposed in our study:\n",

    "To begin, we needed to find a public dataset that contained the historical financial data of the S&P 500. In order to do this, we used the yfinance API to gain daily trading data from 1990 to the present {cite}`yfinance`. From this data, we added extra technical indicators that gave us more information about how the prices were moving. \n",
    "\n",
    "We note that for our research, we do have some assumptions. First, we assume that the Yahoo Finance data itself is trustworthy. For example, for the \"Adjusted Close\" column Yahoo is using historical stock splits and dividend distributions to calculate this. Therefore, we are assuming that Yahoo's data is accurate, valid, and represents the true stock market. Second, we assume that financial data is non-stationary, thereby using log returns rather than normal return values. This is to ensure that the models we use are appropriate to be used as they model stationary data. Lastly, we are assuming that the EMH holds true as we are going through our research."
