    "## Introduction \n",
    "Many of us wonder how to profit from the financial world, specifically the stock market. Logicially, this task is very challenging and is one of the deeply researched fields in academia. According to the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** {cite}`malkiel2003efficient`, asset prices reflect all available information, indicating that it is impossible to regularly \"beat the market\" using solely historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we will look to analyze how and what to predict the stock market through the S&P 500 index ((`^GSPC`)). By utilizing historical trading data from 1990 to 2025, we aim to answer the specific questions proposed in our study:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actually Predicting Market Movement** 1. Can we accurately predict short-term movements in the S&P 500 using historical price and macroeconomic data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance of Additional Technical Indicators** 2. Which market indicators contribute most strongly to prediction accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Comparison** 3. How do simpler predictive models compare to more advanced models in forecasting performance?"
